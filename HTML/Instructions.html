<p>You need to do some set-up in order for this app to work</p>

<p>This app needs to get contents out of your Apps Script file in order to send that content to GitHub.
You must enable the Apps Script API.  The Apps Script API can only be enabled for your account through your
GCP dashboard.  https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard
You must associate a GCP (Google Cloud Project) project with this Apps Script project, and enable the Apps 
Script API for the GCP project.  The Apps Script API is what gets the content out of your Apps Script file.
Step by step instructions are provided below:
</p>

<ul class="w3-ul">    
  <li>In order for this Apps Script project to access your Apps Script files in your Google Drive, you must do
    the following.</li>
    
  <li>1) If you don't have an existing GCP project, then you must create a new GCP project.
    The GCP project that you associate with this Apps Script project, must have the Apps Script API enabled.</li>
  <li>There are two types of GCP projects for Apps Script, "default" and "standard."</li>
  <li>The default GCP project is automatically assigned to every Apps Script project.  You can't see the default GCP
  project.  You can't access the default GCP project, and you can't enable any APIs in it.  So, you need to create a 
  "standard" GCP project and link it (associate it) to your Apps Script project.</li>
  <li>Go to your Google Cloud Platform - https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?authuser=0</li>
  <li>Navigation menu - IAm and Admin - Manage Resources</li>
  <li>If you don't have an organization - then create an organization</li>
  <li>Create Project</li>
  <li>Get the GCP Project Number</li>

  <li>2) From coded editor</li>
  <li>Resoures Menu - Cloud Platform Project</li>
  <li>Enter Project Number</li>
  <li>Set Project</li>
       
  <li>3) Open GCP project</li>
  <li>APIs and Services</li>
  <li>Enable APIs and Services</li>
  <li>Enable the Apps Script API</li>
    
  <li>Run the code</li>
       
</ul>
